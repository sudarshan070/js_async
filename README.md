# Asynchronous JavaScript

The aim of the exercise is to understand how Asynchronous JavaScript works. ANd learn about things like :-

- Call Stack
- Event Loop
- Web API's
- Promises
- XMLHttpRequest

## XMLHttpRequest

```js
const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
xhr.addEventListener("load", () => console.log(xhr.response));
xhr.open("GET", "https://api.github.com/users/nnnkit");
xhr.send();
```

## CORS

**CO**

1. Cross Origin means different origins (github.com or javascript.info) You are not allowed to share data from one origin to another origin.

2. When you want to share the data form one origin to another you will have to implement something called CORS - policy on the server. Something like (github is allowed to use data from javascript.info)

3. When you have CORS issue from origin `null` you have to use live(parcel, webpack etc) server to build the website.

4. You can also use CORS proxy something like `https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/`. Proxy is something that acts like a middleware where you send request to the proxy url and that url send request to the server you are trying to access. **Don't use it on production**

## Getting Started

**Setup your project by following these instructions:**

- [ ] Make your own copy by forking this exercise.
- [ ] Go to the settings of the newly forked repo and add your mentor as a collaborator on the repo.
- [ ] Make a clone of your forked repo.
- [ ] Create a new branch called develop: `git checkout -b develop`.
- [ ] Work on the exercise on your `develop` branch.
- [ ] Push commits to `develop` branch ONLY. Command - `git push origin develop`.

**After you are done.**

- [ ] Submit a Pull Request to merge `develop` branch into the `master` branch of your repo. **Please don't merge your own pull request.**
- [ ] Add your mentor as a reviewer on the PR.
- [ ] The assigned mentor will review the exercise and pass feedback.
- [ ] Once the mentor merges the PR to `master` branch, you are done with this exercise. Yay!

## Goals ðŸŽ¯

- [ ] Every folder has a `.md` file and a `.js` file
- [ ] Go through the instruction form `.md` file and complete the function in the `.js` file.
